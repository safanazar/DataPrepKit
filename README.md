# DataPrepKit

DataPrepKit is a Python library that provides a set of tools for data preparation tasks. It aims to simplify the process of data cleaning, handling missing values, and encoding categorical data. The library is built on top of the pandas and sklearn libraries, making it suitable for data scientists and machine learning engineers.

## Features

1. Data reading:
    Reads data from a variety of file formats.

2. Handling Missing Values
    Using the stated procedures, missing data are removed or imputed.

3. Data Summarization:
    Creates statistical summaries for the selected columns, including mean, variance, standard deviation, and quartiles.

4. Categorical data encoding:
    Converts category variables into numerical representations.



## Dependencies 

This code requires the following libraries:

• pandas: A powerful data manipulation library for Python

• numpy: A library for the Python programming language, adding support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices, along with a large collection of high-level         mathematical functions to operate on these arrays

• sklearn: A machine learning library for Python that provides simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis
